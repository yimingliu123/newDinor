This GitHub repository contains the source code and test data for reproducing the experiments in the paper titled "Enhancing Rice Breeding Efficiency through Semi-Supervised Detection and Segmentation of Panicles and Leaves". The research was funded by the Biological Breeding-National Science and Technology Major Project (2023ZD04076). The paper is currently submitted to The Visual Computer. We commit to providing complete training datasets with corresponding annotations for non-commercial users after official publication, in order to promote agricultural development and facilitate further research in this field.
